**DISCLAMER:**

This project was created within an academic research setting, and thus should
be considered as EXPERIMENTAL code. There may be bugs and deficiencies in the
code, so please adjust expectations accordingly. With that said, we are
intrinsically motivated to ensure its correctness (and often its performance).
Please use the corresponding web repository tool (e.g. github, bitbucket, etc)
to file bugs, suggestions, pull requests; we will do our best to address them
in a timely manner.
